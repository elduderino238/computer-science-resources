# Computer Science Resources

While studying Computer Science, I have accumulated resources on important
fields in the form of books, papers, video recordings of the lectures, blog
posts and podcasts. I used them as references (e.g. whenever I encountered a
task in the corresponding field) and studied parts of them but (because I
studied Physics and Mathematics at the university, not Computer Science) never
had a chance to study them in depth. Bookmarks, book names and vague
recollections of State-of-The-Art knowledge references were scattered across my
Goodreads, YouTube, Notion lists until I decided to compile a single list and go
through the resources one by one. I thought enumerating those and getting a
complete list of great work might also be useful to the others. Since studying
those is a serious work, it might take years to carefully study the subjects
presented in the collection but all those topics are extremely exciting and
certainly worth investing time into for anyone doing Software Engineering.

Unlike other lists with CS resources, mine does not focus on a particular
feature of listed readings (e.g. being free, as in
[ossu/computer-science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) curriculum),
nor does it try being a "complete" curriculum. I have divided the collection
into two parts:

- _**The Fundamentals**_ (the list below) is the "short" list of "classic"
  resources get I get recommended the most by wonderful engineers I have a
  chance to talk to. It focuses on the most important strategic concepts in the
  field and strives to give a good overview of the basics one needs to master to
  work in that field.
- [_**Further Reading**_](./further-reading.md) contains more links to short
  blog posts, articles from the internet, more specific resources. This list
  contains more of the resources I found myself while browsing the internet and
  found useful at some point.

This collection is also inspired by (and to some degree based on)
