# Computer Science Resources

Compilation of Computer Science courses, books, blog posts and videos.

- _**The Fundamentals**_ (this list) - "classic" resources recommended to
  me by someone or popular in the internet. Focuses on the most fundamental and
  important concepts in Computer Science.
- [_**Further Reading**_](./further-reading.md) - short blog posts, articles
  from the internet, more specific resources. Less fundamental, more practical
  (and typically up-to-date).
- [_**Periodic**_](./periodic.md) - resources to check ~monthly for new updates.
  This is mostly for newsletters and blogs that provide high-quality content.
